# photo-lib-organizer

Weekend-ish project that I use to organize a dump of my photos. 

There are two things that it does at the moment: 

* Scans a directory and builds an index (Filename, location, EXIF information, Hash)
* Detects duplicates based on hash value and build an html page for me to review

## Tech sctack

* .NET 7
* MS SQL

## Plans

* Remove duplicates ✨
* Fix File creation date to reflect the information found in EXIF ⌛
* Sort and group files by
  * Year-month taken 📆
  * Location 🌍
