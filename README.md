# photo-lib-organizer

Weekend-ish project that I use to organize a dump of my photos. 

There are two things that it does at the moment: 

* Scans a directory and builds an index (Filename, location, EXIF information, Hash)
* Detects duplicates based on hash value and build an html page for me to review

## Plans

* Remove duplicates
* Fix File creation date to reflect the information found in EXIF
* Sort and group files by
  * Year-month taken
  * Location
